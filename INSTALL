Prerequisites
=============

GTK+ requires the following packages:

 - The GLib, Pango, GdkPixbuf, ATK and cairo libraries, available at
   the same location as GTK+. GTK+ 3.4.2 requires at least
   GLib 2.32.0, Pango 1.30.0,
   GdkPixbuf 2.26.0, ATK 2.2.0
   and cairo 1.10.0.

 - Each GDK backend has its own backend-specific requirements. For
   the X11 backend, X11 R6 and XInput version 2 (as well as a number
   of other extensions) are required.

 - gobject-introspection 1.32.0 or newer.

Simple install procedure
========================

  % gzip -cd gtk+-3.4.2.tar.gz | tar xvf - # unpack the sources
  % cd gtk+-3.4.2                          # change to the toplevel directory
  % ./configure                                    # run the `configure' script
  % make                                           # build GTK+
  [ Become root if necessary ]
  % make install                                   # install GTK+
